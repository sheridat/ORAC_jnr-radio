Contributors description
========================
I have build a prototype with modified sources of your PI Radio Project for a 4x40 display. This display has two controllers. I use a PCF 8574 Port Expander to manage the two Controllers of the display. The backlight function must be managed from one of the GPIO ports on the Raspberry. But that not so difficult.

For the PCF 8574 I used a modified backpack from the german dealer "Pollin Elektroink". The P7 from the Pollin backpack I have connected directly (that was for the Backlight function) to manage the "E2" Pin from the display.
