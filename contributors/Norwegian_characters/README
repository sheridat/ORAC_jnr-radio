Contributors description
========================
What I noticed is that my panel is a japanese version (HD44780UA00) 
and not a European (HD44780UA02). This means that I mostly have 
Kana-characters in addition to standard ASCII. But I found that the
HD44780 support up to 8 custom characters, so I adapted the code from this web page:

http://ailin.phychembio.com/miscellany/1422/

I just modified it slightly and added it to lcd_i2c_pcf8574.py with definitions for the special Norwegian characters I need, and added the necessary lines to translate_class.py. Now I have a working display with Norwegian characters. This could probably be useful for other people as well.
