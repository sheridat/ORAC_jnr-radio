This directory contains software contributed by other constructors.

The code in these sub-directories is provided "as is" and without any warranties.
Neither can any guarantees be given that the software in these sub-directories
will be compatible with future releases of the main-stream software.
As Bob Rathbone is unable to test these programs absolutely no support is provided 
so please don't ask for it as the answer will always be the same - no support.
A useful README file is however included in each sub-directory.
