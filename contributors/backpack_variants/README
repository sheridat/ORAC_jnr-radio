Contributors description
========================
I actually took your advice to modify your existing radiod.py source to support the I2C version of the LCD display of your Internet Radio. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty and was successfully able to merge the I2C LCD components of your rradiobp.py with the 5-button functionality of your radiod.py and I'm pleased to say it works PERFECTLY!
